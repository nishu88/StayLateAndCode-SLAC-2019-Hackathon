Voice Authentication (using Hidden Markov Model) and Siri/alexa like voice command responder (using tf dataset)



#Problem Statement we chose:

Compatible System Assistant: Similar to Alexa, Siri, develop a voice control package which could run on System without connecting to Internet with a very limited voice command set to authenticate user and authorize him/her to control the System. Also, this package should be customizable for each product which should accept its command set as an input and also should be fault-proof as it frustrates the user to repeat the commands when the product doesn’t recognize them. 


Background: The medical systems offered by GE are mostly used in sterile/wet environment and often user needs to interact with the system by using the touchpad/keyboard which is difficult as hands could be wet/need to re-sterile after using the system, he/she could be wearing gloves and the touchpad doesn’t recognize the input of the user.
